# Monitoring electrical energy generated by solar panels with SigFox

This repository contains embedded software, hardware schematics and a parser (for TagoIO IoT platform) of *Monitoring electrical energy generated by solar panels with SigFox* project.
This consists of an end-to-end project to monitor how much electrical energy is generated by solar panels to recharge a single-cell (3.7V) Li-Ion battery, using SigFox as wireless communication. The goal of this project is to have a way to know for sure how much electrical energy can be generated from a renewable source (solar energy) to given conditions (weather condition, location, size of solar panels, etc.).

## Hardware parts

This project requires the follwing hardware parts:

* RedFox development kit (more info: https://www.curtocircuito.com.br/kit-iot-sigfox-com-edukit-redfox.html)
* Arduino Nano V3 board
* 40-pin female pin header (pitch: 2.54mm)
* 2 or more 12V mini solar panels (the more output current they can supply, the better it is)
* 2 or more 1N5819 Schottky diodes. This project requires 1 Schottky diode per solar panel.
* Step-Down LM2596 module
* Battery charger TP4056 module 
* Single-cell (3.7V) Li-Ion battery (any battery capacity)
* Single-cell Li-Ion battery support
* INA219 module (current and voltage measurement module)
* Reliable 12V power supply (for LM2596 output voltage adjustment)
* Reliable multimeter (for LM2596 output voltage adjustment)
* Some jumpers
* Solder equipment (solder iron, tin, etc.)

## Embedded-side: software

The embedded software used in embedded-side of this project is develped using Arduino IDE (1.8.13 or later), and it's written in C programming language. All required libraried for this embedded software are described in its source-coude file.

## Cloud-side

As cloud-side, this project uses TagoIO IoT platform. For more details on this IoT platform, check this link: https://tago.io/
